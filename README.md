# Backtesting
Creating a back tester in Python

Goal is to get practice with manipulating market data for analysis 
Starting with building the back-testing engine 
    & Data handling functions 

I don't know what I'm doing, but figuring it out as I go.

Initial Commit & Build

Overall Design :
1. Data-Handling
    - How do I manage market data? 
        - Structure
        - Organization
        - Type(s)
2. Data-Modeling
    - How do I represent assumptions? 
    - How do I test models?
3. Display
    - How do I present the data and conclusions?
